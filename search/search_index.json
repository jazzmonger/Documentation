However, our products are composed of modules, and each module is made up of components. This means that when you purchase a FutureProofHomes product, you will receive components and modules to connect and assemble into the desired product. Good modular hardware design allows us to iterate quickly and innovate faster than traditional hardware companies. It also enables you to easily upgrade your products over time. Pretty cool, right?</p>"},{"location":"#need-personalized-help","title":"Need Personalized Help?","text":"<p>The FutureProofHomes team will do their best to keep up with support requests, but we also lean on our community to help all of us.
